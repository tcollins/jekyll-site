title: Trying Jekyll
---

I'm giving [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme a try. Open source software has the best names! 

I don't know if this will be enough to get me into blogging, but I like the idea of using markdown and git to build a simple website/blog.

We'll see how this goes.
